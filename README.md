# ResponsivePortfolio

Homework Assignment 2

Goal: Use existing portfolio from assignment 1 and make it mobile responsive while adding Bootstrap CSS. 

## Description

This week's assignment introduced Bootstrap CSS and media queries to simplify the coding process. The media queries are applied in relation to the webpage's viewport
This portfolio's purpose is to display detailed information about Meredith Grimes's background, interests, and goals in life as she pursues a career in the web development world. All completed projects show the skills that Meredith has and describes what she is capable of accomplishing in Full Stack Web Development.

## Usage 

Navigate the website to read the background of Meredith Grimes, including contact information and completed projects by utilizing the links in the top right corner of the webpage, labeled About, Portfolio and Contact. As time progresses, the portfolio's content will contain more work to demonstrate a variety of qualifications to future employers.

## Take Aways

The motivation for completing this assignment was to have the satisfaction of understanding the new concepts of HTML and CSS and making something work (finally!) through the frustration of figuring it out. Taking on the challenge of learning something new and grasping onto the concepts is very rewarding. Some code was more of a hurdle than others to cross, such as creating a sticky footer, understanding where to place a <div> and why, drawing out a picture of the webpage on paper to process what functions to code in HTML and CSS, and not throwing my computer against the wall when I felt like my brain was going to explode.
